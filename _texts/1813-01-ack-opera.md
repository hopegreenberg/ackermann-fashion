##PLATE 6. - OPERA  DRESS.
A round superfine cloth robe, of the new Russian flame-colour, or pale tan, with long full sleeve, ornamented at the feet with satin of the same colour, in deep vandyke. A fancy bodice, composed of pink satin, and trimming corresponding with the dress, finished with bows of ribband on the shoulders. A cap &#224;  la Mary of Scotland, composed of the same material as the robe, lined with pink satin, and covered with net-beading, which forms a most unique and becoming finish for the edge. The hair divided in the center of the forehead, and in full curls on each temple, blended with a small sprig of the winter berry. Necklace and cross of pearl; bracelets and ear-rings of the same. White satin slippers, trimmed with silver. White kid gloves; and long tippet of spotted ermine.
